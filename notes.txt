npx create-react-app <app-name>
- npx will scaffold all the necessary dependencies to start a react app

A good rule of thumb as to when to use the key attribute is this: Anytime you use the map() function inside of render, or you have a list of the same jsx elements one after another, they need a key attribute

key is used by React to render multiple components
- it updates the dom only the component that needs to update

life cycle method
- methods called at diff stages at when the component gets rendered

any attribute inside custom tag is props
anything inside custom tags are children

state turns into props
- state usually live in only one location

setState is asynchronous

whenever setState gets called, render gets re-rendered
- don't setState in render

babel transpile jsx down to js for older browser

place state at top so that it one way go down to children

arrow function auto bind this to App Class or when handleChange was first defined
lexical scoping - lexically scope this to when method was first defined which is App component

use arrow function on any class methods you define that are not part of react (render, componentDidMount)
